A registration fee must be sent along with the application so that the child's name may be registered for the year and class for which admission is sought. The fee is neither refundable nor adjustable and it is valid only for the specified academic year. Registration of a child is not a guarantee of her admission.</p>

                <li>Every child registered for admission into classes LKG to XII is expected to appear for an Aptitude/Proficiency Assessment at the school.</li>
                <li>Offers of admission are given on the basis of the results of these Assessments and depend on the number of vacancies in each class. Some preference is given to children of transferable Government officials and serving Armed Forces personnel. Preference is also given to those whose real siblings have studied or are at present studying in the School.</li>
                <li>Any requests for other preferential treatment are not entertained. Only in very rare and exceptional cases, the members of society reserve the right to exercise its discretion in the matter of admissions.</li>

                        <li><pre>Transfer Certificate, Character Certificate</pre>
                        A valid Transfer Certificate from the School last attended, issued by the Principal immediately prior to the child joining Parth Public School as well as a Character Certificate, are essential requirements and must be submitted on the day that the child joins School.
